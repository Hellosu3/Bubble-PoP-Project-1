-As a player I would like to see my score in a visible location, so I may keep track of my score  while playing
-As a player I would like to have the option to play again, after the game has ended.
-As a player I would like to see aesthetic colors and visually enticing game materials


There's only one way to win, but two ways to lose. When the bubble floats off the screen you lose, and or the timer runs out.
This is a multi-player game. When playing with another player, first player must click no when prompted to play agin. Single players may opt to play agin. Take turns playing then manually add the score by clicking player 1 or player 2 in the upper left hand corner.
Press start once for an easy round, while double clicking will challenge you. Are you up for the callenge?

I was able to use pictures a classmate drew to add to my game. I couldnt have the player's score work.
